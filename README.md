## Program Walkthrough
<p align="center">
    Objective: Lay out the Active Directory architecture. We are going to set up a virtual network within Azure, and use Windows Server 2022 VM to create a AD Domain Controller. We will then set up a Windows 10 VM as a client device, and join it to the domain. Once that foundation is setup, we will create users using powershell, as well as configure, and manage Group Policy to manage accounts. We may add more to this, stick around and see!

    Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is used to centrally manage user accounts, passwords, permissions, and devices across a network. AD enables organizations to scale efficiently by organizing and securing access to resources, such as files, printers, and applications, while also enforcing policies and authentication protocols.
